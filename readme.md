Week 4 day 2 Decode String Lab

In this lab, I have implemented the "Shift Decoder," a JavaScript function designed to shift lowercase letters in an input string based on numeric values provided within the string. By leveraging the alphabet string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' as a reference, the function accurately handles character shifting. It takes any input string containing both lowercase letters and numeric values, and efficiently produces the shifted output. For more details and usage examples, refer to the provided code examples above.
